# Pigeon Messages Template

This repository contains a template to simplify the process of defining messages for use with [Pigeon](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/pigeon).
To use this template, first install [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/), then run,

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/TilEM-project/pigeon-msgs-cookiecutter
```

and complete the prompts.
Now, edit the example message, add more, and enjoy.
